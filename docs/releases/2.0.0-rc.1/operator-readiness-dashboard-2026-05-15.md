# ECC Operator Readiness Dashboard - 2026-05-15

This dashboard is an operator snapshot, not a release approval. Use it to decide
the next ECC 2.0 work batch and to keep Linear, GitHub, and repo evidence in
sync. Before publishing, repeat the checks from the final release commit in a
clean checkout.

| Local worktree | Current with caveat | `main...origin/main`; unrelated `?? docs/drafts/` ignored |
| Security sweep | Current with follow-up | IOC scan, audits, and package-manager hardening completed |
| Linear roadmap | Current with follow-up | `ECC Platform Roadmap`, ITO-44 through ITO-59 |

## Linear Operating State

Project:
<https://linear.app/itomarkets/project/ecc-platform-roadmap-52b328ee03e1>

Active issue state after this pass:

| Issue | Lane | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ITO-44 | Completion audit and readiness dashboard | In Progress |
| ITO-57 | Supply-chain intelligence and local protection loop | In Progress |
| ITO-59 | Discussions and public response queue | In Progress |

Still-open lanes:

- ITO-45: ECC 2.0 preview pack, Hermes skills, packaging, and cross-harness
  readiness.
- ITO-46: name availability, Claude plugin, Codex plugin, and package channels.
- ITO-47: release notes, articles, and social copy since last release.
- ITO-48 and ITO-49: AgentShield enterprise iteration and live supply-chain
  intelligence.
- ITO-50 through ITO-54: ECC Tools payments, deep analysis, setup
  recommendations, queue automation, Linear sync, and observability.
- ITO-55: legacy audit, prune, attach, or salvage.
- ITO-56: final publication gate, release notes, and push notifications.
- ITO-58: ECC Tools GitHub access blocker.

## Decisions From This Pass

- The checked GitHub queues are below the explicit target, so the next work
  should not spend more time closing nonexistent PRs/issues.
- The discussion queue is current, but repeatability is weak. ITO-59 remains
  open until the sweep is scripted or documented as an operator command.
- The Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack protection pass is strong enough for current
  local protection, but ITO-57 remains open until incident response and IOC
  updates become a durable workflow.
- The release is still blocked by publication, package, plugin, billing, and
  announcement gates. Passing `platform:audit` alone is not proof that ECC 2.0
  is publishable.

## Next Work Order

1. Build the ITO-44 completion dashboard into a repeatable command or generated
   markdown artifact.
2. Productize the ITO-59 discussion queue sweep so the maintainer-touch and
   accepted-answer checks do not depend on manual GraphQL.
3. Continue ITO-57 by turning emergency hardening into documented incident
   response and scanner update workflow.
4. Resume release/publication lanes ITO-45, ITO-46, and ITO-56 only after the
   readiness dashboard can be refreshed from commands.
